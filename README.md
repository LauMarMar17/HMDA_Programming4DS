# HMDA_Programming4DS
Final Project of "Programming for Data Science" subject. ETSII - UPM.

## FIRST PART - Web Scrapping

1. __Free Topic:__ Each group of students can choose the web site to access and the data to extract from the selected web site. Main requirement is that information must be retrieved from the web site using Web Scraping (static or dynamic) and store the extracted data in tabular format (csv)
2. __Requirements:__
   * At least 3 resources (entities with associated information). E.g. in the finance use case with ‘investing.com’, a resource could be the stock of a company, and the information to
retrieve from the resource (in that case) would be the daily price of the company stock during the last two years, for doing later an analysis of time evolution of stock price (return, risk, volatility, …)
4. __Expected results:__
   * Python script to retrieve data from web site and store it in .csv files
   * The different .csv files 

## SECONT PART - Data Manipulation and Visualization

1. __Topic:__ Using the data obtained in the first part using Web Scraping, this part is
about processing and visualizing the data in order to perform some analysis. The analysis should be performed in order to answer a set of questions related with the data. The questions must be defined by each work group and should be answered providing support in the form of data (lists, tables, …) or plots.
It will assessed the creativity and the interest of questions formulated and answered.
2. __Data Treatment:__ It must be performed at least one data transformation of the methods and techniques covered in the course (i.e. manipulation, wrangling and/or transformation). E.g. Group movies by theme/topic or by actors or by producers … etc.
3. __Data Visualization:__ The part of data visualization should be guided by the questions to answer. Thus, each work group should define a set (i.e. 2-3) of questions to be
answered providing support in the form of plots (covered in the course) and/or any other type of information extracted from collected data. E.g. In the case of movies, answer questions like: which are the themes/topics of the top-k most awarded movies? Or top-k list of movies with good valuation from audience but with reduced or no prizes …etc
